## Project Overview

This repository hosts an **Agentic AI Integration Platform**, a modular Python-based system designed to orchestrate multi-tool data aggregation using AI agents. Built with LangChain for agentic workflows, it enables dynamic query routing across diverse data sources, normalization of outputs, and unified responses. As an expert data scientist specializing in Agentic AI platforms, this project serves as a prototype roadmap for building scalable AI-driven data integration solutions, starting from an MVP and evolving into production-grade systems.

Key use cases include:
- Aggregating heterogeneous data (e.g., from APIs, databases) for queries like real-time event analysis or multi-source intelligence.
- Extensible architecture for adding tools, agents, or LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Grok).

The MVP demonstrates a central router agent using the ReAct pattern to invoke mock tools, with room for real integrations.

## Features

- **Modular Tool Registry**: Easily add or swap data tools with standardized schemas (using Pydantic).
- **Agentic Orchestration**: LLM-powered routing and planning for query handling.
- **Data Aggregation**: Fuse results from multiple tools into coherent outputs.
- **Security & Config Management**: Environment variables for API keys via `.env`.
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Automation Scripts**: Quick setup, run, and test commands.
- **Extensibility**: Configurable via YAML for dynamic tool loading; ready for async, APIs (FastAPI), and deployment (Docker).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-ai-platform.git
   cd agentic-ai-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
   - For other LLMs (e.g., Grok), add relevant keys and update imports.

4. Run setup script (installs deps and verifies env):
   ```
   python scripts/setup_dev.py
   ```

## Usage

### Running the MVP
Execute the main script for a sample query:
```
python src/main.py
```
This runs an agentic query like "Sample query for data integration" and prints aggregated results.

### Testing
Run all tests with coverage:
```
pytest src/tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```
Or use the script:
```
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

### Custom Queries
Modify `src/main.py` to change the query or integrate new tools.

### Adding a New Tool
1. Create a file in `src/tools/` (e.g., `new_tool.py`):
   ```python
   from src.schemas.output_schema import ToolOutput

   def new_tool(query: str) -> ToolOutput:
       # Implement logic
       return ToolOutput(source="NewTool", data=[...])
   ```
2. Register in `src/agents/router_agent.py`:
   ```python
   from src.tools.new_tool import new_tool
   tools.append(Tool(name="NewTool", func=new_tool, description="..."))
   ```
3. Update `configs/tool_registry.yaml` for dynamic loading (future phases).

## Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to evolve the MVP into a robust platform, emphasizing iterative development, testing, and scalability. As an expert in Agentic AI, the focus is on validating core agentic flows early while building extensibility.

### Phase 1: MVP Setup
- Establish directory structure and mock tools.
- Implement basic router agent with ReAct pattern.
- Add smoke tests and basic scripts (e.g., `run_local.sh`).
- **Milestone**: End-to-end query processing with aggregated mocks.

### Phase 2: Tool Expansion
- Integrate real APIs/databases for all tools.
- Enable async tool calls for parallelism.
- Dynamic loading from `tool_registry.yaml`.
- **Milestone**: Handle heterogeneous data with normalized outputs.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Add agent memory for conversational queries.
- Implement error retries, logging, and monitoring.
- Expose as REST API via FastAPI.
- **Milestone**: Multi-turn interactions and basic UI (e.g., Streamlit demo).

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- Achieve 80%+ test coverage (unit, integration, E2E).
- Optimize for cost/performance (e.g., LLM caching).
- Benchmark agent latency.
- **Milestone**: Reliable, performant system with CI/CD hooks.

### Phase 5: Deployment & Scaling
- Containerize with Docker and compose.
- Deploy to cloud (e.g., AWS/EC2 or Kubernetes).
- Add auto-scaling and secrets management.
- **Milestone**: Production demo with monitoring.

### Phase 6: Future Enhancements
- Multi-LLM support (e.g., Grok integration).
- Advanced fusion (e.g., embeddings for semantic merging).
- Security audits and compliance.
- Community contributions for new tools.

**Risks**: API dependencies—mitigate with mocks. **Success Metrics**: <10s query response, 10+ tool support.
